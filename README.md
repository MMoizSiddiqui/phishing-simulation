# Phishing Simulation – Google Spam Filter Bypass

## Overview
This project demonstrates how **phishing emails can bypass AI-driven spam filters** using structured HTML, SMTP spoofing, and social engineering tactics. The simulation replicates **Google's unauthorized login alert**, embedding interactive elements to analyze phishing attack vectors and user susceptibility.

## Features
- ✅ **Spam Filter Evasion** – Crafted to bypass Google Mail's detection mechanisms.
- ✅ **Email Spoofing** – Mimics legitimate Google security alerts.
- ✅ **Interactive Elements** – Embeds links and scripts for phishing analysis.
- ✅ **Safe for Testing** – Designed for educational and research purposes only.

## Prerequisites
